# Fun-Sandbox-for-Gmod
This is just a gamemode for Garry's Mod, and the reason why it is called Fun Sandbox is because of the fact that there is no
restrictions on what to do, because all CVars are enabled, allowing you to type any command, if you know what you are doing.

Alpha V0.7.35 x13 for Garry's Mod 14
Changelog below: *NOTE: THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE AND I, CAN-O-AWESOME, MAY NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR GAME-BREAKING CHANGES TO THE GAMEMODE'S CODE!

Bugfixes:
1: Several CVars have been fixed.

Improvements:
Several performance tweaks made to reduce lag and increase framerate, the only tweaks I will go into details with
are better memory usage and use of only minimal Lua code.




More to come soon!

Can-o-awesome, Out!!!!
